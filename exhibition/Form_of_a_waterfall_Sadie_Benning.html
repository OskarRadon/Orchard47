			From September 9th through October 7th Orchard presents "Form of a waterfall," an installation of drawings, video and sound works by Sadie Benning. Benning's two-channel video installation "PLAY PAUSE" (2006), will be screened at Dia Art Foundation, 548 West 22nd Street between September 13th &ndash;15th.
			<br><br>	"Form of a waterfall," the title of which is derived from a phrase from the Wonder Twins animated television characters' spoken-command-logic of transformation, explores notions of abstraction and identity in contemporary art. The drawings hover between abstract geometric studies and nearly erotic mandalas. They represent a long-developing parallel to Benning's videos, rarely made public. Benning, who is known for her visual and auditory story telling, posits her engagement with abstraction as a performance-based exchange, in both its production and reception. Benning's abstractions direct interrogations of identity to object-making in liberating fashion. An interactive selection of her "play/pause" audio cassettes &ndash; analog cut-ups constructed between a cassette- playing boom-box and a turntable &ndash; accompany the drawings. Benning's live-action line-drawing video "One Liner" from 2003, which was shot with the Pixelvision camera the artist has been identified with since 1989, uses a play/pause-produced soundtrack and is an integral part of the installation.<br><br>
			Benning was celebrated for the Pixelvision video works she began making when  she was fifteen years old. Those diaristic collages of music, self-portraiture, and anecdote reworked the graphic vocabulary of first-generation video with a queer perspective. Benning co-founded the rock band Le Tigre, incorporating many of the concerns of her video practice into their music. Benning's intersecting of sexual note-taking with city living informed Le Tigre's promiscuous popular music genre-bending. A solo exhibition of Benning's large scale portrait paintings along with the premier of "PLAY PAUSE," a video made in collaboration with Solveig Nelson, was held at the Wexner Center in 2006. <br><br>
			A program of evening events will be presented at Orchard concurrently with "Form of a waterfall," including a presentation / discussion with Benning on September 15; "I Want to Know the Habits of Other Girls," a forty-minute opera composed and performed by Dewayne Slightweight on September 16; film / video works by Jennifer Reeves on September 21; short films by Alexander Kluge newly translated by Henry Pickford, courtesy of Lili Chin and Leslie Thornton. on September 28; and a film preview of "Unidentified Vietnam No. 18" by Lana Lin and Lan-Thao Lam on October 5. <br>
