<div id="headline3"><br>I Like You And You Like Me</div><div id="blurb">Characters/Roles:
<br/>
Artist: Rafal Betlejewski (Betlej) 
<br/>
Curator: Barbara Piwowarska 
<br/>Dates: Dec. 29-31, 10am &ndash;6am
<br></div><div id="exhibitionsblurb">A curator meets an artist. The curator happenes to be a WOMAN and the artist turns out to be a MAN. The WOMAN curator is married and the artist MAN has a family with two children. Curator and artist begin to work together on projects. Instantly they discover that they like one another, even maybe beyond the formal professional relationship. The fact of their mutual interest is obviously inapropriate and exploring it on a personal level is absolutely forbidden. They decide to turn that relation (perhaps one they only imagine) into a piece of exhibit. The project begins on a day when this idea is being related to the curator and the artist’s spouses, as well as other people. For the two parties involved it leaves behind comfortable space: <i>The space of the banal hipocricy</i>. From that moment on, all their reactions in regards to the project become the substance of the experiment. But where does it end? The artist and the curator set a limit: they will enter the gallery space for three days. Three days that will put the once intimite curator-artist relation to the test: what is it, was it worthwhile, will it obstruct their future work, will it influence their lives beyond the point of no return – or will it be just another gimmick? Was the truth important for its own sake or was it the corrupting force of the public eye that made them do it? And finally, how the so called “private life” and middle class standards attached to it, influence (limit or enrich) the freedom of the artistic expression? Is the artist still a question posed to society or is he/she just another member of the establishmet earning his/her money in a different profession? The gallery space will be a laboratory of the space between MAN and WOMAN, the artist and the curator.
One may associate the project with Mircea Cantor's film <i>Departure</i> (2004) and Joseph Beuys action <i>I Like America and America Likes Me </i> 1974.
Who becomes the wolf, deer or coyote is as yet unknown.<br>

Rafa&#322; Betlejewski (Betlej), born in Gda&#324;sk 1969, lives and works in
Warsaw.
Enterpreneur, specialised in marketing and brand strategies, activist,
author of social and artistic projects in non-artistic spaces,
including: Here and Now in Zielona G&#243;ra 2001, Burn your Shame in Warsaw
2002–2004, I prefer Poland 2002, Unfinished in Konin 2004, a poster
campaign on the occasion of the anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising,
Would you go as well? 2004, stickers Sorry, Water 2005, virus Euro AGD
2005, Milk – Order The Theater by The Phone in TR Warszawa 2005,
Workshops in Constructing the Self (as Father, Manager, Writer) in the
framework of the Mobile Academy Warsaw 2006. Since 2006 he has been
running the project Everyday Life Theatre in public spaces, examining
the the border between true and false, turning his task to elaborating
technologies for constructing identity through unmasking the mental and
material props used by people for this purpose. The actor-director
first appears in the title role of a character he is attempting to make
as realistic and convincing as possible, then unmasks the illusion
created by brutally negating it. Before an oblivious, astonished
audience who think they are discovering the truth, the actor constructs
another illusion, with himself as the director of a fleeting theater
which in cunning fashion leads to an investment of the space in which
the presentation is taking place. By unmasking his borrowed identity,
he introduces a further artificial identity, the illusion of which is,
for the spectator, significantly more powerful. The d&#233;nouement depends
on the gradual unmasking of the second illusion in the hours and days
after the performance, after leaving the space where it took place. In
his work Betlej examines the social oppression of given roles,
mystification and contemporary identity understood as a contemporary
ready-made.<br>
