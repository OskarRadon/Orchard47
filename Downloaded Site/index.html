<p>
Like the son of William Tell, standing there nervously
with an apple perched on his head, caught between The
State and its brutal enforcement of the Law
(metonymically represented by a hat on a pole) and the
distended individualism of his father, Orchard makes
an attempt at a painting exhibition.
<p>
Perhaps now more than any other period in recent
memory, the presumption of an immaculate self-identity
between the objects that go by the name "painting" and
the subjects given the name "painter" goes
unquestioned. While we might welcome the new readiness
to allow the practice of painting to generate its own
historical and contemporary concerns, the new accord
runs the risk of unreasonably delimiting the kinds of
questions which may be posed in its name. Famously for
Debord, the question was not whether filmmaker,
writer, theoretician, anarchist was the better name to
describe his practice, but how to refuse that
nomination itself.
<p>
Painters Without Paintings & Paintings Without
Painters brings together the production of 14 artists
and collaborative groups for whom facile
identifications remain questionable.
<p>
Orchard is a collectively organized exhibition
and event space in New York's Lower East Side. The
gallery's twelve partners are artists, filmmakers,
critics, and art historians and curators Â– though
several of them combine these practices. The members
of Orchard come from disparate backgrounds associated
with the New York experimental film and video
scenes, late 80s and early 90s institutional
critique practices, 90s non-yBa in the UK, and the
South American political conceptualist tradition. The
group does not have a univocal position in terms of
their working methods or views on art. In fact, their
Exhibition program is intended to put the diversity
of its members' practices into discursive motion. The
production of a social relation is central to
Orchard's project, and is posed against the forms of
separation explicit and implicit to the conventions of
commercial galleries. To this end the program
eschews solo exhibitions in favor of group
exhibitions, is defiantly transgenerational mixing
established artists with lesser known artists, and its
values or economy are directed towards the
reproduction of overlooked historical practices in
order to re-insert them into contemporary discourses,
as well as facilitating the production of new work.
<P>
Since opening in May 2005, Orchard has restaged or
produced unrealized projects by Michael Asher, Andrea
Fraser with Allan McCollum, Christian Philipp-M&uuml;ller,
Dan Graham, and Lawrence Weiner. Amongst others, historical works by Luis
Camnitzer, Juan Downey, and Martha Rosler have been
exhibited and new works by Merlin Carpenter, Nicol&aacute;s
Guagnini, Jutta Koether, Lucy McKenzie, Jeff Preiss,
Blake Rayne, Stephan Pascher, Jeff Preiss, R.H.
Quaytman, and Karin Schneider have been produced.
