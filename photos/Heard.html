			In 1990, Armaly and M&uuml;ller hired Muzak Brussels to put together a program of "music" to enhance sales of contemporary art. This program was played in the stairwell of the main gallery building in Cologne during the opening of the multi-site exhibition "The K&ouml;ln Show" in the spring of 1990. That event was recorded in turn, mixing the sounds of the Muzak together with the opening crowds. Additional layers were added as the piece went on tour to Stuttgart, Graz, Zurich.

			One of three major of audio installations produced by Adrian Piper in the lat 1970s, <i>Aspects of the Liberal Dilemma</i> was first presented at John Weber Gallery in 1978. While the work is supposed to be installed in its own room with the audio playing out-loud, Piper has agreed to its presentation here with the audio on headphones, as presented in her retrospective at the Alternative Museum in 1987. Headsets are available at the table at the rear of the gallery.

			<br/>
			audio CD, 10 minutes
			<br/>
			Edition of 5
			<br/>
			USD 15,000
			<br/>
			The project <i>Untitled</i>  was initiated in 2002 when Fraser asked Friedrich Petzel Gallery to arrange a commission with a private collector that would involve a sexual encounter between artist and collector recorded on videotape. The resulting document, shot in a hotel room with a stationary camera, was presented as an unedited, sixty-minute DVD with the sound erased. In the spring of 2004, Fraser undertook to edit the audio recorded by the camera during the encounter. Unlike the DVD, the audio has been densely edited, condensed to ten minutes with all sounds of the collector edited out, putting the listener in the position of the participant. The videotape of <i>Untitled</i> was first presented in Fraser's 2003 retrospective a the Kunstverein in Hamburg. The audiotape is being presented here for the first time.

			Fabio has dinner with his NY dealer, a small gallery called Kravets-Wheby. They discuss payment of a small sume due to sales.  The issue of taxes comes up. Fabio explains in Argentina people mostly do not pay taxes. Dealer looks surpised and utters: Oh really?...oh wow! How does the country survive?! Fabio laughs.  In 2001 economy collapses, 5 presidents in 2 weeks, riots. Fabio begins recording in mocking American accent "Oh really?... oh wow! how does the country survive?! to the tune of different pop songs (Oasis, Beck, Beatles, VU, Love and Rocket, Men at Work, etc.)

			<i>Automatic Circuit</i>, 1967/1968
			stickers posted around the city in spaces like telephone booths,
			bathrooms, hallways, etc.; recording on telephone answering machine
			Available upon request

			<i>The fact that you have called  shows that you saw a sticker (little poster) in which there were photographs of a woman and a man and a telephone number . You have thus closed a communication circuit that started when you read the poster and is ending now.</i>
			<br/>
			<i>This is an answering machine.

			when your call comes in it automatically connects to the tape on which this text has been recorded.</i>
			<br/>
			<i>Thus the common structure of telephone communication has been changed and all the information goes toward you regardless of anything you might say but this circuit does not inform about anything, it only speaks about itself and you can keep listening or hang up the telephone. My name is Roberto Jacoby and the answering machine was made of Panasonic.</i>
